### Hi there 👋

I'm fascinated by questions at the intersection of law and tech.

You can find out [more about me on my website](https://natfoo.vercel.app/), and can [view the source code here](https://github.com/nat-foo/nat-foo/tree/main/portfolio). These are just a few fast facts 🍃

- 🔭.  I’m currently working on ways to be more intentional about my privacy online.
- 🌱.  I’m currently learning security+ principles, chinese, and smart contract legalities.
- 👯.  I’m looking to collaborate on AI and morality issues.
- 🤔.  I’m looking for help with the balance between anonymity and functionality.
- 💬.  Ask me about why I think lawyers are programmers in disguise.
- 📫.  How to reach me: natfoo@pm.me
- ⚡.  Fun fact: This README was not generated by GPT-3. [Or was it?](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/fsf-funded-call-for-white-papers-on-philosophical-and-legal-questions-around-copilot)


N.B. In any capacity afforded to me, I wish to abstain from taking part in Copilot's, and any related AI/ML training data, in all that I do on the Internet, and especially on GitHub. This is not in an attempt to stifle the progress of AI, but rather to allow regulation the time it requires to catch up.
