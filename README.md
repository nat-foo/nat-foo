### Hi there 👋

I'm fascinated by questions at the intersection of law and tech.

- 🔭.  I’m currently working on ways to be more intentional about my privacy online.
- 🌱.  I’m currently learning security+ principles, chinese, and smart contract legalities.
- 👯.  I’m looking to collaborate on AI and morality issues.
- 🤔.  I’m looking for help with the balance between anonymity and functionality.
- 💬.  Ask me about why I think lawyers are programmers in disguise.
- 📫.  How to reach me: natfoo@pm.me

N.B. In any capacity afforded to me, I wish to abstain from taking part in Copilot's, and any other AI/ML training data, in all that I do on the Internet, and especially on GitHub.
