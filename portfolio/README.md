# NatFoo Portfolio Website

I built this in a day to demonstrate to a friend how the bulk of a template's config data could be loaded externally. View `apps/portfolio/src/app/app.tsx` and take note of lines 2-3. The template is stored locally while the config data can be loaded from elsewhere. To my friend, and to random passersby: hopefully this helps!

Feel free to use this for your own portfolio, just come up with your own config data ;)
